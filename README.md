A short course on R Graphics
========

The goal of this short course is to provide more tuition and examples of plotting data in R. The target audience is those that have attended an introductory course (e.g. https://github.com/johnomics/basicr) but are not yet independant R users. The emphasis is on providing lots of worked examples, and the included primer covers lots many common use-cases.

Note that we cover 'base' graphics and not more sophisticated solutions such as lattice or ggplot2
